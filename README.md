# array-sort-time-comparison
My solution for Chapter 7 Exercise 3 of “Introduction to Programming Using Java”.

Problem Description:
In Subsection 7.4.4, it is mentioned that the standard sorting method Arrays.sort() is
much faster and efficient than selection sort. Write a program to test this claim. To be
specific, your program should create a large array filled with random real numbers. It
should use both Arrays.sort() and selectionSort() to sort the array, and it should
time how long it takes to perform each sort. Furthermore, it should do the same thing for
a large array of random Strings. To find the times, you can use System.nanoTime() (see
Subsection 2.3.1 and the example TimedComputation.java).
